CS53_Final_Project
==================

TODO:

*   Finish the loop in driver and add in output for the winner
*   finish move_to_teacher to have the the classmate move toward the door and 
then teacher once inside the school. If no valid moves can be made in the direction 
of the teacher then it should call the rand_move function.
*   Finish the random placement of Hoover so that she is not placed on the door
*   modify get_score function into Get_grade function that gets the classmate's 
grade and removes it from the board while setting m_graded to true.
*   use the move function instead of rand_move once move_to_teacher is finished
*   Finish this todo page.  


BUGS:
*   Sometimes Hoover doesn't appear to get placed.
*   Classmates sometimes dissapear.
*   Sometimes "holes" appear in the school, perhaps when classmates walk through them.
*   classmates are still able to move on top of each other with the current valid_move function
This causes an infinite loop in the program.
*
