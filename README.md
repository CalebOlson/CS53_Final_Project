CS53_Final_Project
==================

WORKS PERFECTLY ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME!!!!

TODO:
*   make sure all things that should be commented are commented correctly.
    Especially the Pre and Post conditions because we changed a lot of the 
    functions significantly without changing their comments.



BUGS:
*   Sometimes Hoover doesn't appear to get placed.
*   Sometimes the classmates will not finish picking up trash and the program 
    will go into an infinite loop.
